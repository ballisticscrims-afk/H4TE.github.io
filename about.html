    <p>
      H4TE GAMING is a competitive esports organization dedicated to excellence
      across all FPS game modes. Built by players, for players, we compete with
      purpose, discipline, and an unbreakable team mindset. Our focus is not
      limited to one title or playstyle—we adapt, evolve, and perform across
      multiple FPS platforms and competitive environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      At H4TE GAMING, we believe success comes from more than individual skill.
      Communication, strategy, and trust are the foundation of everything we do.
      Every member is held to a high standard of professionalism, respect, and
      commitment, both in and out of competition.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are always looking to grow our roster and welcome new talent—whether you
      are an experienced competitor, a rising player hungry to improve, or a
      dedicated team-oriented gamer ready to put in the work. If you have
      passion, consistency, and the drive to compete, there is a place for you
      here.
    </p>

    <p>
      More than just an esports team, H4TE GAMING is a family. We support one
      another, push each other to be better, and create an environment where
      everyone can grow. Wins matter—but loyalty, respect, and unity matter more.
